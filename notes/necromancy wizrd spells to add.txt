Choke (Necromancy, Conjuration/Summoning)
Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2
By means of choke, the caster causes a pair of ghostly hands to appear around the throat of a single victim. The victim must be a human, demihuman, or humanoid, and must be within 30 yards of the caster. The hands will choke and strangle the affected victim for the duration of the spell; each round, the victim suffers 1-4 hit points of damage from the choking hands. If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he suffers half-damage each round.
Choke can be negated by dispel magic or a similar spell; the victim cannot wrench the ethereal hands away from his neck. The victim makes all attack rolls at a -2 penalty while affected by choke. The material component for this spell is a handkerchief or similarly-sized piece of cloth that has been tied in a knot.

Cloak Undead
(Necromancy)
Range: 10 feet/level
Components: V,S
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 or more creatures in 15-foot radius
Saving Throw: Neg.
This spell renders undead creatures
within its radius invisible both to the naked
eye and to the detect undead spell.
The undead remain invisible as long as
they remain within 15 feet of the spells
center. If they move beyond that radius or
attack in any fashion, they immediately
become visible. The detect invisible spell
will reveal their presence, as will true seeing
and similar devices. The spell can be
cast on the caster, on an object, or on a
willing subject.
Cloaked undead cannot normally be
turned, though if the priest can detect
them, as above, he may turn them in the
normal fashion. Cloaked undead cannot
enter areas normally protected from undead,
nor gain any other advantages.

Mummy Touch
(Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Components: V,S,M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Neg.
Upon casting this spell, the wizard gains two abilities. First, he is immune to the rotting disease carried by mummies for the duration of the spell. He also is empowered with the ability to inflict this rotting disease on others by touch for the duration of the spell.
Mummy rot causes the flesh of the victim to putrify and decay. This causes a loss of 2 points of Charisma per month and is fatal in 1-6 months if untreated. Mummy rot can be cured by cure disease and more powerful magics which duplicate cure disease. While under the effects of mummy rot, the victim cannot be healed using cure light wounds, cure serious wounds, or heal spells and normal healing takes place at 10% of the regular rate.
The casters appearance does not change as a result of this new ability and no other abilities are altered or improved other than the two noted above. The mummy touch affects everyone the caster touches during the duration of the spell. The caster can choose to end the spell prematurely, but once ended, the abilities are lost.
Undead are immune to the effects of mummy touch, as are other creatures who would not normally be affected by the attack of a mummy (such as iron golems or xorn). Mummy touch cannot be granted to another individual. The disease functions only by direct touchit cannot be used to poison food or drink. The caster can be damaged normally by mummies, but if slain will not rot. Those slain by the caster using mummy touch will not rot as well.
The material components of this spell are a pinch of mummy dust and drop of blood.

Paralyze
(Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Components: V,S,M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None
Upon casting this spell, a wizard gains the ability to paralyze those he touches for 2-8 rounds. Those touched must make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. If the saving throw is made, they suffer no ill effects from the paralyze spell. Creatures which are immune to paralysis, as well as undead and unliving creatures such as golems, cannot be affected by this spell. The caster must roll a successful attack roll in order to strike an opponent with the paralysis.
The material component of this spell is a piece of ghoul flesh.

PHBR4 p139
Mummy Rot (Necromancy)
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One victim
Saving Throw: Special
This spell allows the caster to attack with a rotting touch similar to that of a mummy. If the caster touches a human, demihuman, or humanoid victim, the victim immediately loses 2-12 (2d6) hit points and is infected with a rotting disease which is fatal in 1-6 months. For each month the rot progresses, the victim permanently loses 2 points of Charisma. While infected, the victim recovers lost hit points at 10 percent of his normal rate.
The rotting disease can be cured only with a cure disease spell; cure wounds has no effect. A regenerate spell will restore damage but will not otherwise affect the course of the disease. If a victim makes a successful saving throw, he is not infected, but he still suffers 2-12 hit points of damage.
The material components for this spell are a piece of rotten fruit and a piece of a mummy’s cloth wrapping.

Heal Self (Necromancy)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Special
This healing spell requires as its material components two drops of water, a drop of blood, and a gemstone of not less than 100 gp value. The caster holds these in one hand, claps that hand to his body, and intones the spell. A saving throw vs. spell is must be made. If the throw fails, the caster is healed for 4d8 hit points of damage (but cannot gain "extra" hit points by this means). Also, any blindness, poison, weakness, or nausea, however caused, is banished from the caster's body.
If the throw succeeds, the caster is healed of all damage to his body, including the full use of broken limbs and organs. All afflictions (including rot grub and other parasitic infestations, diseases such as mummy rot, and lycanthropy) are ended.
In addition, the caster temporarily gains 1 point of strength, with the applicable bonuses (a being possessing 18 strength attains 19 strength, regardless of any percentile normally possessed). This augmentation lasts for 1 turn, plus 1 round/level. The healing effects of the spell, whether the saving throw succeeds or not, are permanent.

Shadow Form (Necromancy)
Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the caster temporarily changes himself into a shadow. The caster gains the movement rate, Armor Class, hit dice, and all abilities of a shadow. His chilling touch (requiring a normal attack roll) inflicts 2-5 (1d4+1) hit points of damage on his victims as well as draining one point of Strength. Lost Strength returns in 2-8 (2d4) turns after being touched. If a human or demihuman victim is reduced to 0 hit points or 0 Strength by the caster in shadow form, the victim has lost all of his life force and is immediately drawn into the Negative Material Plane where he will forever after exist as a shadow.
All of the caster’s weapons and equipment stay with him, but he is unable to use them while in shadow form. He is also unable to cast spells while in shadow form, but he is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells, and is unaffected by cold-based attacks. He is 90 percent undetectable in all but the brightest of surroundings. Unlike normal shadows, a wizard in shadow form cannot be turned by priests. At the end of the spell’s duration, there is a 5% chance that the caster will permanently remain as a shadow. Nothing short of a wish can return the caster to his normal form.
The material components for this spell are the shroud from a corpse at least 100 years old and a black glass marble.

FR: A p65
Master Undead
(Necromancy)
Range: 10 yards/level
Components: V,S,M
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.
This powerful spell allows the caster to
control the actions of any type of undead
as if they were intelligent creatures under
the effect of a charm person spell. Undead
so controlled can perform precise tasks
for the caster.
The caster can affect as many undead as
he or she has experience levels. In cases of
mixed undead, the weakest will be affected
first, then those with more hit dice.
All undead affected must be within a cubic
area 50 feet on a side.
Undead are permitted a saving throw
vs. spells to avoid this spell. Liches and
undead with 10 or more hit dice have a
bonus of +4 to the saving throw to avoid
the effects of the spell.
Controlled undead are not the same as
creatures under the effect of this
enchantment/charm magic. The control
will last until the spell duration ceases,
then the undead are restored to their own
(often nominal) control. Further, the
caster does not need to know any common
language with the undead to effect
the control. And last, the undead can be
ordered to perform actions which are selfdestructive
and the caster can attack them
without the spell being broken.
The material component of this spell is
a crushed diamond worth at least 500 gp,
which is consumed in casting.
